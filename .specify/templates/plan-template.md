# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify alignment with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- **Mission & scope:** Feature supports "Search → Verify → Apply" and does not defer core-loop work without justification.
- **Technical standards:** Plan uses Next.js latest (App Router), React latest, Tailwind + Shadcn/ui, LangGraph for agentic flows, Supabase with RLS; all deps latest; no HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs; agent logic separate from UI; secrets in Server Components/Actions with `server-only`. Monorepo layout: code in `apps/web`, `apps/agent`, or `packages/*` per constitution; each app deployed as separate Vercel project.
- **Security & PII:** No raw PII to third-party LLMs; placeholders (e.g. `{{USER_CITY}}`) for Professional Advisor search; Trust Filter (domain check + dynamic due-date verification by current academic year) for scholarships; no data brokering.
- **Workflow:** Spec and plan exist; spec is what, plan is how; tasks are atomic and marked done when verified.
- **UX/UI:** MVP scope only; WCAG 2.1 AA; Lighthouse 90+ Performance and Best Practices.
- **Forbidden:** No inline styles; no floating promises in LangGraph; no mock data in production; Loading/Empty states handled.
- **Data integrity:** .edu/.gov weighted 2× over .org; dynamic cycle checks—due dates after today = Active, past due dates = "Potentially Expired"; no hardcoded academic years.
- **Documentation protocol:** Plan references official docs for Next.js, Zod, Supabase, LangGraph JS; App Router only (no `pages/`); Zod for schemas, Supabase types for DB; LangGraph Checkpoints for agent persistence.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
